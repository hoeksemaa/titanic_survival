# titanic survival

my ML is rusty so i'm using these resources to get back on track:
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=test.csv
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/pytorch-tutorial-develop-deep-learning-models/

## running

example run command: 
```
python3 run_me.py -t train.csv -s test.csv
```

## data

not adding data to github but containing in the same folder
directly uploading it to github seems dumb
