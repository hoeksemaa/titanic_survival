# titanic survival

my ML is rusty so i'm using these resources to get back on track:
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=test.csv
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/pytorch-tutorial-develop-deep-learning-models/

other nice resources:
- https://towardsdatascience.com/building-efficient-custom-datasets-in-pytorch-2563b946fd9f
- https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/pandas/pandas-read-csv-with-headers

## running

example run command: 
```
python3 run_me.py -d train.csv
```

## data

not adding data to github but containing in the same folder

directly uploading it to github seems dumb

## future changes i could implement
- separator field for datafiles as argparse argument
- titanic dataset is 3 diff files w/ explicit test and train sets; will only use train data for training AND testing for today's simplicity
